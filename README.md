# nextdepartures

**nextdepartures** is a realtime, live transit departure board that works for ALL [GO Transit]([url](https://www.gotransit.com/en)) and [Grand River Transit]([url](https://www.grt.ca/en/index.aspx)) stops. This can be put on any display to turn it into a departure board, so that students and other folks that use the terminal don't miss their:
* **ION Light Rail** Trains
* Local **GRT** Buses
* Intercity **GO Transit** Buses

Inspired by the recent redesign of departure boards at Toronto Union Station, this departure board matches the Metrolinx style exactly and will direct travellers to the correct platform â€” a feature not yet available on any other app.
